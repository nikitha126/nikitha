#include<stdio.h>
 int input (void)

why is #include  used?
is a directive to the C preprocessor. Lines beginning with # are processed by the prepro-
cessor before compilation. that is :#include<stdio.h> pg:42
why int input (void)?
:int main( void )
int main( void )here refers to the main function is a part of every C program. The parentheses after main indicate that main is a program
building block called a function.pd:42
why void is used?in this function int input(void)
The void in parentheses here means that main does not receive any information.pg:42

{
      int a;
      printf("enter a number\n");
      scanf("%d",&a)
      return a;
}


why is {}used in the program?
A left brace {  begins the body of every function A corresponding right brace }
ends each function This pair of braces and the portion of the program between
the braces is called a block.pg:42
what is int here refers ?
here int is that it holds a interger value that could be a whole number such:7,-9,8,-79 pg:47
ex:int a:here "a" can be any whole number from 0to infinity
what is printf?
it is used in promoting the messages it displays the literal "Enter first integer" and positions the cursor to the beginning of the
next line. This message is called a prompt because it tells the user to take a specific action.like:printf("enter a number\n");pg:47
what is scanf?
uses scanf (the “ f ” stands for “formatted”) to obtain a value from the user. The function
reads from the standard input, which is usually the keyboard. This scanf has two arguments,
"%d" and &integer1 .pg:47
what is return a?
